# Santa's Portfolio Challenge

### Event: μLearn's Illuμmnate Event

## About the Challenge
Santa Claus, the legendary gift-giver, is taking a break from his North Pole duties to explore life as a **beginner Software Engineer**. Apparently, delivering billions of presents overnight wasn’t challenging enough! This portfolio is part of μLearn's Illuμmnate event challenge, where we help Santa land his first tech job. Spoiler: He’s also open to remote roles because, well, he’s got reindeer.
